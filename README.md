## Minesweeper

Old implementation of minesweeper done in java that I found lying around in on my computer.

Has some weird decisions like using `((Integer) i).toString() + ":" + ((Integer) j).toString()` to concat strings.
Decided not to fix, but to preserve as a memory.

No tests of course.

#### Changes to original

Added Module-Info and converted to maven+java11.
